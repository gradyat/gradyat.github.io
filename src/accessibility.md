# Accessibility Statement

## Conformance

This website is conformant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) Level AA. This means that the website supports all WCAG 2.1 Level A & AA success criteria without any exceptions.

<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance" title="Explanation of WCAG 2 Level AA conformance"><img alt="Level AA conformance, W3C WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2" src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/wcag2.2AA-blue.svg"></a>

I recognize that accessibility and usability goes beyond WCAG conformance. Where feasible, I will incorporate additional accessibility best practices and WCAG Level AAA success criteria.

## Known limitations

There are currently no known accessibility issues.
